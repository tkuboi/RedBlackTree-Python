# RedBlackTree-Python
An implementation of Red Black Tree which balances itself in both insertion and deletion cases.
The range(lo, hi) and the range_count(lo, hi) return the keys and the number of keys respectively in the range including keys equal to lo but excluding keys equal to hi, and assume that no duplicate keys exist in the tree.
